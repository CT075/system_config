# dotfiles and other things

by Cameron Wong (cam@camdar.io)

Inspired heavily by [Jake Zimmerman](https://github.com/jez/dotfiles).

## Installation

One way or another, get scripts/init onto the host system. Running that script
should clone this repo onto the system and make all the necessary symlinks.

Note that this isn't really designed for use by people that aren't me, so just
cloning the repo and running with it is probably not going to work.
