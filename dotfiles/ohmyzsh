# With the caveat that I've refactored out all of the aliases in this file to
# various "aliases.sh" files scattered throughout sys_base, this file is
# essentially my original zshrc with MODULE_NAME, MODULE_DEPS, and the
# module_exec() declaration wrapped around. As such, it's missing a lot of the
# formatting things I would otherwise take care to preserve. Oh well.
